"Love JJ wholeheartedly but he has zero grounds to demand the weight or be making “final offer” type of speeches. Dudes had five professional fights. Two YouTubers both with zero records. Two other dudes who didn’t even fight back, either whined and cried or straight ran. And then an L. Jakes got like what is it now seven or eight? And I think he’s only got one L if I’m no wrong. And he’s now established at 200 to go against (yes an old man) the legend? And it’s known he’s been trying to put on weight as well. Like why would he derail his current path and goals to fight against somebody with nothing on their record to really gain from?? This just doesn’t make any sense to me. And it’s not him ducking the fight if he wants to stay at 200. He could just as easily retort “final offer February 2025, 200Ib, America, if you don’t take it I knew you were too scared to blah blah blah”. Except he’s got a record. With some decent bodies on his list. Like who is JJs biggest dub? Logan? I know y’all can’t say Pineda. That sht was not a fight😂 Weller? Jake beat Nate. Who had incredible boxing success in the ufc. And he beat him going the distance. Nate thrives in going the distance and eating shots. Doesn’t matter if he competed in ufc. He was bound to not do boxing per his ufc contract. However look at how good of a boxer he was in the ufc. Not to mention other bodies he’s got but Diaz is a freaking warrior and an elite striker. That’s impressive and I can’t stand the Paul’s but you gotta give flowers where they’re due and respect that. 💯 💯💯",positive
"185? Dude is 235 right now. You want him to drop 50 lbs? Sounds like a cop out of the fight cause you know that's impossible.  My 2 year old will fight you at 20 lbs, What're you scared?",negative
"Jake Paul has run from KSI for years, since he beat Logan. He hasn't moved on from the JJ fight as he claims, he has just run and run, and kept running, but until he fights KSI no one will respect him the way he wants. At this point I'd respect Jake more if he just fought JJ, and he would make a lot of money doing it because everyone who has followed this boxing stuff from the early days will want to see it happen.",positive

"As a HUGE Sidemen /Ksi follower, I don’t wanna hear the “I am not Jake Paul, I am here to fight, I want to fight” bollox because when Jake challenged Ksi first, JJ wanted to focus on his music or quote on quote “say face”. So after finally challenging Jake when he was ready, he can’t expect him to say yes like a goof and come running. The world doesn’t revolve around Jj. Jj ducked Jake first coz of his shitty music then Jake ducked JJ for whatever reasons but let’s not pretend Jj was ducking first lol",positive

"All he had to do is fight someone who was an experienced boxer with decent skill and he looks better than Jake Paul, which is all he really cares about. Instead he comes up with another gimmick that he thinks is gonna make him look impressive by doing this 2v1 bullshit against another 2 unqualified opponents. Like he’s almost no better than Jake with these fights that just refuse to have anything serious or even. Fighting Tommy Fury is serious and a good fight. These gimmick  fights may make for an entertaining event, but if he really wanted to prove he was taking boxing seriously and the A side of Jake Paul, all he needs to do is fight a real fight against someone who would be an actual challenge to beat. That’s how you prove something, that’s how you improve.",negative

Slim has already said he's not tagging Anthony Taylor. So, it's pretty much him vs Slim.

Also, if he does want to do 2 vs 1 then he must fight slim first then towards the end Anthony Taylor otherwise it won't work.",negative

"Brother what the hell is up with JJs team xD
Why are they reaching out Amir Khan. He's still only 37 and was a world class boxer with insane speed that will catch JJ. 
JJs team is stupid when it comes to picking fights. Where as Jake's team is smart and picks the oldest motherfuckers there are.
Nate Robinson (Athlete but 0 fighting)
Askren (MMA Champ with 0 striking)
Woodley (UFC Champ with just an overhand right)
Silva (UFC legend but currently almost 50 and he lost his last several fights in the UFC as well as way off his prime)
Nate Diaz (UFC star. Like one of the bigger stars in the organization. His boxing is piss average and with them pads on his hands his boxing ain't gonna hurt shit)
Mike Tyson (Old af)
All of Jake's opponent choices are so much more strategic. Where as KSI's team wanting him to fight boxers. Stupid af. Boxers and MMA fighters too different in skill in pure boxing obviously. Hell even Jorge Masvidal is a very dangerous fight.",negative

Your strategy was clever and nearly worked. But you were trying to land 1 big shot then clinch and out point with cardio in the clinch. It neutralized Tommy's combos and boxing ability. But it was a horrible watch for us and not really boxing. More like an mma clinch fight.",positive

I accept,positive
Ughhh these 2v1s are stupid. There’s no real win behind it in my eyes. Like the first one it was garbage he fought two guys who didn’t know how to punch. If it’s an actual 2v1 at the same time then he gets a cop out if he loses. If he wins an actual 2v1 then it’s not really boxing is if? Definitely a fight. Might even be harder than a Jake fight. However there’s zero prep value in doing this? There’s no symmetry in this to a 1v1 against a real fighter. No translation. Entirely different gameplan. If he wants an ACTUAL warmup fight then do a 1v1 with the goal in mind of going the distance or getting a last round knockout. Like how in the world does this warm you up for a the Jake fight?? Whole thing is filled with a bunch of things that make no sense… someone wake me up in a decade when the Jake fight actually finally happens😂,negative

You are no longer sure of having real friends, you no longer sleep at night, you are tired, mentally, physically, spiritually. This world calls you weak, and you start to believe it, you are desperate. Know this, God is with you, he sees your pain, your suffering, your loneliness and he wants to help you and is just waiting for that. But for that, we have to open the door. God loves you with a love so pure that he sent his only son Jesus Christ to save you from death. So return to him and your heart will be at peace BE BLESSED",positive

I’m not going to lie I think that’s way too much of a challenge. Just taking on one of them is a big enough fight and let’s face it no disrespect but Slim is the easy fight and that’s not that easy 😂. I have a feeling KSI will lose both and blame it on the fact that he fighting two people which is a fair comment but it’s stupid you shouldn’t do it anyway. Anyway I am a KSI fan and I will support him just think it’s way out of control and if he pulls off both fights that’s just crazy,negative
man just stop with the fighting bullshit and make videos,negative
KSI gotta stop demanding things like hes the #1 in this fight... your jakes btch in this fight not other way around.. he has better fight and better wins lool. ksi always tryna make it his rules so than he can say people ran when he just wants every advantage.....

I doubt Jake would agree. He’s too much of a pussy. He’s been ducking JJ for years. Here’s what will happen. Jake will hear about this and joke about it on the site formally known as Twitter. He will likely throw around insults before saying “Ok bro let’s do it but with these conditions.” He will then go on give ridiculous stipulations. Weight. Pay. It doesn’t matter he’ll come up with anything he can to delay it. Then he’ll ask JJ to make a dumbass bet instead before finally pussying out and refusing. Probably going on about how superior he is and overplaying his achievements. Or saying it was the other way round. If he actually does agree to the fight then I will actually be surprised.,negative

"Tbh I am a little disappointed in you  . I thought you wanted to transition after the tommy fight  , Fighting pro boxers ,experienced  Wba athletes/ boxers with some sort of pedigree in the actual boxing scene not YouTube boxers . Instead you keep calling out individuals who you know for sure you will beat  basically easy fights . I absolutely agree that you might be one of the best or maybe the best boxer in the  YouTube  scene. But thats all you will be your legacy will always be known as the best youtube boxer but nothing more . 

Btw  I am a fan but as a fan I want you hear the truth and dont want to sugarcoat things . We as a fanbase  all are thinking it doesnt matter how many you take on wheter its 2v1 ,3v1,4v1 etc it doesnt mean shit if they are all YouTube boxers .  This just reminds us of another swarmz and pineda situation all over again.  At the end  i will back you always but we all want your legacy to transcend from just the youtube boxing scene to real boxing scene and for that  we all know what you need to do fights pro boxers similar to names you mentioned like amir khan etc basically wba athletes",positive
